# NJS's Vue Template

A nice and simple Vue template to let me (or anyone else) quickly whip up new projects.

## Features

-   [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) + TypeScript
-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management
-   [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) with some sensible defaults.
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) + [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)

## Installation

Build info

## Recommended IDE

This was meant to be used with VS Code, but it should work with any editor.
You'll be prompted to install any recommended extensions that aren't installed.
If no one on your team is using VS Code, just delete the `.vscode/` folder.

## Next steps

-   [ ] Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
-   [ ] Run `yarn dev` to start Vite and make sure everything's working.
-   [ ] Delete `LICENSE.txt` from the root of the directory.
    -   If your project still uses an MIT License, just edit the author and year.
-   [ ] In `package.json`, change the project name and version.
-   [ ] Delete the `.git/` folder if you cloned this repo. Then run a `git init` to start fresh.
-   [ ] Do whatever. This code is yours, now.
